# Overview

The freeRASP is available for Flutter, Android, and iOS developers. We encourage community contributions, investigations of attack cases, joint data research, and other activities aiming to make better app security and app safety for end-users.

freeRASP SDK is designed to combat

* Reverse engineering attempts
* Re-publishing or tampering with the apps
* Running application in a compromised OS environment
* Malware, fraudsters, and cybercriminal activities

Key features are the detection and prevention of

* Root/Jailbreak (e.g., unc0ver, check1rain)
* Hooking framework (e.g., Frida, Shadow)
* Untrusted installation method
* App/Device (un)binding

Additional freeRASP features include low latency, easy integration and a weekly [Security Report](#security-report) containing detailed information about detected incidents and potential threats, summarizing the state of your app security.

The commercial version provides a top-notch protection level, extra features, support and maintenance. One of the most valued commercial features is AppiCryptÂ® - App Integrity Cryptogram.

It allows easy to implement API protection and App Integrity verification on the backend to prevent API abuse:

* Bruteforce attacks
* Botnets
* Session-hijacking
* DDoS

It is a unified solution that works across all mobile platforms without dependency on external web services (i.e., without extra latency, an additional point of failure, and maintenance costs).

Learn more about commercial features at [https://talsec.app](https://talsec.app).

# Usage

We will guide you step-by-step, but you can always check the expected result in the example.

## Step 1: Prepare Talsec library

Add dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file

```yaml
dependencies:
  freerasp: 5.0.0-dev.1
```

and run `pub get`

### iOS setup

If you are upgrading from a previous version of freeRASP, please remove the old `TalsecRuntime.xcframework`
and integration script from your project.

**Note: You need Xcode 13 to be able to build the application.**

### Android setup

* From root of your project, go to **android > app > build.gradle**
* In `defaultConfig` update `minSdkVersion` to at least **21** (Android 5.0) or higher

```gradle
android {
...
defaultConfig {
    ...
    minSdkVersion 21
    ...
    }
...
}
```

## Step 2: Setup the Configuration for your App

Adding imports to the top of file, where you want to use Talsec:

```dart
import 'package:freerasp/talsec_app.dart';
```

Make (convert or create a new one) your root widget (typically one in `runApp(MyWidget())`) and
override its `initState` in `State`

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    //TODO: freeRASP implementation
  }
}
```

and then create a Talsec config and insert `AndroidConfig` and/or `IOSConfig` with highlighted
identifiers: `expectedPackageName` and `expectedSigningCertificateHash` are needed for Android
version.

* `expectedPackageName` - package name of your app you chose when you created it
* `expectedSigningCertificateHashes` - list of hashes of the certificates of the keys which were
  used to sign the application. At least one hash value must be provided. **Hashes which are passed
  here must be encoded in Base64 form**

We provide a handy util tool to help you convert your SHA-256 hash to Base64:

```dart
// Signing hash of your app
String base64Hash = hashConverter.fromSha256toBase64(sha256HashHex);
```

We strongly recommend using **result value** of this tool in expectedSigningCertificateHashes. **Do not use this tool directly** in `expectedSigningCertificateHashes` to get value. If you are not sure how to get your hash certificate, you can check out the guide on our [Github wiki](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community/wiki/Getting-your-signing-certificate-hash-of-app).
.

Similarly, `appBundleId` and `appTeamId` are needed for iOS version of app. If you publish on the
Google Play Store and/or Huawei AppGallery, you **don't have to assign anything**
to `supportedAlternativeStores` as those are supported out of the box.

Next, pass a mail address to `watcherMail` to be able to get reports. Mail has a strict
form `name@domain.com` which is passed as String.

If you are developing only for one of the platforms, you can leave the configuration part for the
other one, i.e., delete the other configuration.

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  initSecurityState();
}

Future<void> initSecurityState() async {
  TalsecConfig config = TalsecConfig(

    // For Android
    androidConfig: AndroidConfig(
      expectedPackageName: 'YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME',
      expectedSigningCertificateHashes: ['HASH_OF_YOUR_APP'],
      supportedAlternativeStores: ["com.sec.android.app.samsungapps"],
    ),

    // For iOS
    iosConfig: IOSconfig(
      appBundleId: 'YOUR_APP_BUNDLE_ID',
      appTeamId: 'YOUR_APP_TEAM_ID',
    ),

    // Common email for Alerts and Reports
    watcherMail: 'your_mail@example.com',
    isProd: true,
  );
}
```

### Dev vs Release version

The Dev version is used during the development of the application. It separates development and
production data and disables some checks which won't be triggered during the development process:

* Emulator-usage (onEmulatorDetected, onSimulatorDetected)
* Debugging (onDebuggerDetected)
* Signing (onTamperDetected, onSignatureDetected)
* Unofficial store (onUntrustedInstallationSource, onUnofficialStoreDetected)

Dev vs Release is currently managed using `isProd` flag in `TalsecConfig` class:

```dart
TalsecConfig(
   isProd: true,
   ...
)
```

`isProd`  defaults to  `true`  when undefined. If you want to use the Dev version to disable checks described above, set the parameter to  `false`. Make sure that you have the Release version in the production (i.e. isProd set to `true`)!

## Step 3: Handle detected threats

Create `AndroidCallback` and/or `IOSCallback` objects and provide `VoidCallback` function pointers
to handle detected threats:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  // Talsec config
  // ...

  // Talsec callback handler
  TalsecCallback callback = TalsecCallback(
    // For Android
    androidCallback: AndroidCallback(
      onRootDetected: () => print('root'),
      onEmulatorDetected: () => print('emulator'),
      onHookDetected: () => print('hook'),
      onTamperDetected: () => print('tamper'),
      onDeviceBindingDetected: () => print('device binding'),
      onUntrustedInstallationDetected: () => print('untrusted install'),
    ),
    // For iOS
    iosCallback: IOSCallback(
        onSignatureDetected: () => print('signature'),
        onRuntimeManipulationDetected: () => print('runtime manipulation'),
        onJailbreakDetected: () => print('jailbreak'),
        onPasscodeDetected: () => print('passcode'),
        onSimulatorDetected: () => print('simulator'),
        onMissingSecureEnclaveDetected: () => print('secure enclave'),
        onDeviceChangeDetected: () => print('device change'),
        onDeviceIdDetected: () => print('device ID'),
        onUnofficialStoreDetected: () => print('unofficial store')),
    // Common for both platforms
    onDebuggerDetected: () => print('debugger'),
  );
}
```

If you are developing only for one of the platforms, you can leave the callback definition for the
other one, i.e., delete the other callback definition.

Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community/wiki/Threat-detection) to learn more
details about the performed checks and their importance for app security.

## Step 4: Start the Talsec

Start Talsec to detect threats just by adding these two lines below the created config and the
callback handler:

```dart
void initState() {
  // Talsec config
  // ...
  // Talsec callback handler
  // ...

  TalsecApp app = TalsecApp(
    config: config,
    callback: callback,
  );

  app.start();
}
```

## Step 5: Additional note about obfuscation
The freeRASP contains public API, so the integration process is as simple as possible. Unfortunately, this public API also creates opportunities for the attacker to use publicly available information to interrupt freeRASP operations or modify your custom reaction implementation in threat callbacks. In order for freeRASP to be as effective as possible, it is highly recommended to apply obfuscation to the final package/application, making the public API more difficult to find and also partially randomized for each application so it cannot be automatically abused by generic hooking scripts.

### Android
The majority of Android projects support code shrinking and obfuscation without any additional need for setup. The owner of the project can define the set of rules that are usually automatically used when the application is built in the release mode. For more information, please visit the official documentation
* https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code 
* https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/usage

You can make sure, that the obfuscation is enabled by checking the value of **minifyEnabled** property in your **module's build.gradle** file.
```gradle
android {
    ...

    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled true
            shrinkResources true
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile('proguard-android.txt'), 'proguard-rules.pro'
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 6: User Data Policies
See the generic info about freeRASP data collection [here](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Community/tree/master#data-collection-processing-and-gdpr-compliance).

Google Play [requires](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?hl=en) all app publishers to declare how they collect and handle user data for the apps they publish on Google Play. They should inform users properly of the data collected by the apps and how the data is shared and processed. Therefore, Google will reject the apps which do not comply with the policy.

Apple has a [similar approach](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/) and specifies the types of collected data.

You should also visit our [Android](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Android/) and [iOS](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-iOS/) submodules to learn more about their respective data policies.

And you're done ð!

# Troubleshooting

### \[Android] `Could not find ... ` dependency issue

**Solution:** Add dependency manually (
see [issue](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Flutter/issues/1)).

In android -> app -> build.gradle add these dependencies

```gradle
dependencies {

 ... some other dependecies ...

   // Talsec dependency
   implementation 'com.aheaditec.talsec.security:TalsecSecurity-Community-Flutter:<version>'
}
```

### \[iOS] Unable to build release for simulator in Xcode (errors)

**Solution:** Simulator does **not** support release build of Flutter - more about
it [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/testing/build-modes#release). Use a real device in order to build
the app in release mode.

### \[iOS] MissingPluginException occurs on hot restart

**Solution:** Technical limitation of Flutter - more about
it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50459272/missingpluginexception-while-using-plugin-for-flutter)
. Use command `flutter run` to launch app (i.e. run app from scratch).

### \[Android] Code throws `java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: No implementation found for...` exception when building APK

**Solution:** Android version of freeRASP is already obfuscated.

Add this rule to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:

```
-keepclasseswithmembernames,includedescriptorclasses class * {
native ;
}
```

### \[iOS] Building using Codemagic fails: `No such module 'TalsecRuntime'`

**Solution:** You have to adjust Codemagic building pipeline. Instructions how to do it
are [here](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Flutter/issues/22#issuecomment-1383964470).

If you encounter any other issues, you can see the list of solved
issues [here](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Flutter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed), or open
up a [new one](https://github.com/talsec/Free-RASP-Flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).

# Security Report

The Security Report is a weekly summary describing the application's security state and characteristics of the devices it runs on in a practical and easy-to-understand way.

The report provides a quick overview of the security incidents, their dynamics, app integrity, and reverse engineering attempts. It contains info about the security of devices, such as OS version or the ratio of devices with screen locks and biometrics. Each visualization also comes with a concise explanation.

To receive Security Reports, fill out the _watcherMail_ field in [Talsec config](#step-2-setup-the-configuration-for-your-app).
